# Predictive Scheduling Warning System Documentation

## Overview

The Predictive Scheduling Warning System is an AI-powered early warning platform that forecasts potential scheduling disruptions, capacity constraints, and operational challenges across America's Home Manager's 430+ planning areas. The system provides 2-14 hour advance warnings with 70-99% confidence, enabling proactive intervention to prevent service disruptions and revenue loss.

## System Architecture

### Warning Types

1. **Capacity Shortage** - Demand exceeding technician availability
2. **Demand Surge** - Unexpected increases in service requests
3. **Technician Shortage** - Staff availability below operational thresholds
4. **Parts Delay** - Supply chain disruptions affecting service delivery
5. **Weather Impact** - Weather-related service demand and operational impacts
6. **Equipment Failure** - Infrastructure failures affecting operations

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate intervention required (0-4 hours)
- **High**: Action needed within 8 hours
- **Medium**: Monitoring and preparation required (8-24 hours)
- **Low**: Awareness and contingency planning (24+ hours)
