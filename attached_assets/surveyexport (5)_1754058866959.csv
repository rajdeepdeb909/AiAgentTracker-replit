However, from the on-set of Sears accepting the job,  this was worst service experience I've ever experienced and here are my reasons.  After filing my claim, I received an email from AHS that ""Sears (atlanta) has been assigned to your service request and will call to schedule your service appointment"". I NEVER received a phone call, or had a pro come to diagnose the issue.   Instead, I received AI generated text and an email requesting info, i.e., model number, error codes, etc.   Basically, the info I supplied was used to diagnose what they thought was the issue.  I was very uncomfortable with this method, because I wasn't certain I had given the correct information, especially since I am visually impaired.  I received several AI generated emails telling me the parts were not available, thus my service was delayed - only to come home and find a box with a part inside that was delivered to my door.  At no time did anyone from Sears call to alert to expect  or explained why it was shipped to my home.  When I called Sears hoping to speak to someone in customer service, to ask about the box I'd received,  I could not get past AI.   Furthermore, AI could not comprehend message, nor would it connect me with a human being.  Therefore, I couldn't anyone at Sears know about the box with a part had arrived.  I've never had an issue diagnose without having  a human being/technician look at the issue firsthand, or have  a part delivered to my home without proper communication/notice.  Again, this was the worst service experience I've ever experienced!!!   ",1559892,SEARS (ATLANTA),7110 ISLEWAY CT,VILLA RICA,GA,APL,30180

Key Issues:
•	Sears has visited three times, and the dryer still does not work. It isn’t drying at all. The last time they were here, the technician said that vent was coughed. I have a service come, clean it, and put a new exterior cover at a cost of $250. I can furnish the receipt if you like.
•	We’ve now had seven, all day, appointments scheduled with Sears. Of those, four were canceled at the last minute (around 5 PM) and rescheduled without anyone contacting us to confirm our availability.
•	On Friday, (the 4th) we had yet another no-show.
•	Today (July 7), we experienced a new level of dysfunction:
o	At 7:32 AM, I received an email saying the technician was on the way.
o	At 8:00 AM, I received another email naming the technician (Nangyalai) who was on his way. He has been already here two times.
o	At 8:36 AM, I received an email saying I had accepted the service estimate — with a signature I never provided.
o	At 8:39 AM, I received a ""paid receipt"" for the visit.
o	At 9:01 AM, I was asked to complete a service review.
o	The technician never showed up. My wife and I were home all morning (with our dog) and received no call, knock, or message. No one came.
I called AHS at 9:11 AM and spent an hour and 11 minutes on the phone. The first representative contacted Sears, who claimed we weren’t home — which is false. The second AHS representative that I spoke to, Michel, told me nothing could be done until Sears submitted their report and that a recall would be needed.
Frankly, this is unacceptable. Why would I be asked to review a visit that never happened? How many more days of work do I have to miss over this? This has already cost me seven work days!

Then after promising I would get a credit for the service fee and a coupon for another $100 for ""Next"" time.  In order to appease my request to reduce my monthly charge of nearly $80.  Then Sears was coming out on the 23rd... then the 29th... Finally...Finally they showed up today... and guess what..
 It was just for one appliance, the dishwasher.  I wasn't surprised at all.  Since the last time I had spoken to a person... I texted...emailed and left messages all about the three appliances.  Each time I got a response about just the dishwasher.

Day 1. It took a month to get the dryer repaired. It got fixed on the 3rd visit. The whole AHS operations is a flawed model. The tech arrives without adequate spare parts. He then orders the parts. He arrives like a week later not  knowing whether all the parts that he had ordered has arrived. As a customer I have no clue as to what got ordered and how the part looks like . Tech arrives and finds that not all parts have arrived. IInnitor part comes broken to pieces( poor packaging). When I called Sears, the tech asks me to talk to spare parts company . When I called they said they would not talk to me and would only engage Sears who ordered it . False scheduling notification.a form AHS. Sears tech does not arrive. Had to call and escalate with AHs. Please read through the notes relating to my case.

To start, the technician went to the wrong address—twice—and even submitted a photo of the incorrect location. Despite this error being on Sears' end, the appointment was rescheduled outside of the AHS system, and I was charged a $129 fee that should not have applied.

The technician finally came a third time, repeated the same diagnostic process, and submitted an order for the part. It's now been over two weeks, and the part has still not arrived. Multiple appointments have been scheduled and rescheduled with no clear communication. When I contacted AHS for a status update, I was told there was no information on the part’s arrival timeline.

Out of sheer frustration, I asked if I could request a payout instead so we could purchase a new dishwasher, as we did with our washer and dryer in the past. I was told that was not an option. After weeks of delay and no resolution, we went ahead and bought a new dishwasher ourselves.

When I called to cancel the service, I was then asked why I didn’t request a buyout—which left me stunned. I had asked, and was told no. The process was inconsistent, confusing, and dismissive from both Sears and AHS.

I’ve been a loyal client and expected better. At every step, I encountered a lack of accountability, poor communication, and no real support. This experience has completely eroded my trust in the service.",1562252,SEARS (WORCESTER),307A RIDGEFIELD CIR,CLINTON,MA,APL,01510

The technician suggested I call BGE (which I did).  They found no leaks anywhere in or outside the home, which indicates there is a serious problem still with the stove.  
BGE gave me a notification not to turn the gas back on and this is a major safety issue.  My renters will not be using the stove or oven until this is REPLACED (not repaired) as I do not want my house burning down and I it's only fair to my renters they are safe.

At that time he ran the diagnostic and he said that the water valves were the issue, today, a week later, this guy shows up again with his attitude. 
And after 45 minutes trying to fix the washer he said that the valves weren’t the issue, that he need to order the board. He started running the diagnostic again, and without finishing the diagnostic he left.

They can only come one day a week to my town. Before the first visit I wasn’t informed that my refrigerator needed to be plugged in for 24 hours prior to the appointment, so I had to wait another week for them to come back. Then after they diagnosed the problem and ordered the replacement part no one showed up for the scheduled appointment to install the part. I got a text that the appointment was scheduled and coming up, as usual, but no one came out contacted me. The most frustrating part is that there is absolutely no possible way to contact a human being at Sears to get any info out talk about the problem. I tried everything. There seemed to be an issue between the AHS system and the Sears system also. AHS listed my service appointment date as being on the wrong date (not the date scheduled with Sears and shown on their link) which may have contributed to no one showing up for the appointment. Again, it was almost impossible to get in touch with a human at AHS. I finally figured out how to send a message, but the communication was still confusing. I finally just installed the part myself. This is the second time Sears has failed to fix an appliance, leaving me to figure out how to do it myself. Again, the technicians are great. No complaints with them.

The second technician that came out after the part arrived tried to find every reason possible not to fix my dryer. His name is Ken. Ken's social and customer service skills need help. He was condescending and really had no idea what he was doing. How do I know this? My husband is an experienced industrial electrician and machine repair technician. We like to maintain a home warranty contract and hire someone to fix the issue because he deserves time off as much as anyone else. Ken didn't communicate a plan or even say goodbye. It wasn’t until my husband stopped him on the way out our front door to ask him the plan that he communicated the plan to us. Terrible social skills. Terrible customer service. He is in the wrong industry unless he gets much needed customer service training. He ordered more parts without even opening the dryer to look at it. On the 3rd encounter, after insisting that Ken needed another person with him because he had to lift the entire top portion of the dryer off, the original technician that had come out arrived before Ken. The original technician took the front off the dryer, saw a piece of clothing that had somehow gotten stuck in the fan, removed it, tested the dryer and put the front back on. No parts were needed. He did all this before Ken arrived. Ken's original arrival time was set to be by 8:10 am. No one arrived until after 2:00 pm. If I place another appliance claim through American Home Shield, I will INSIST they do not use this company.

It was gross mismangement on part of both American home shield/front door as well as Sears
- There was no way to reach any human being in Sears (Chat  would never lead to such an option, phone line also would not reach any human - only automated responses)
- Sears kept on automatically re-scheduling services - from 1 week to another week
- when we call AHS/front-door, CSR/supervisors were totally clueless - they did not even know up-to date status and we would have to tell them from beginning what's going on (in spite of asking them to record in their system every time we called)
- Always, their answer would be we are unable to reach Sears, someone will give callback
- in call-back same story was repeated time and again

There have been several parts replaced. The most recent time started on 5/29. Tech Mario was nice and said he was gonna order 4 parts. A few were on backorder and had to wait. The first scheduled appointment was June 29th and tech Valdemar said he showed at my house and he never did. I was at my door when he said he arrived. They rescheduled me for July 2nd. Tech Patrick from the start stated I was over limit and he had to call and get approval on something the tech originally had said they would install these parts and if there still a problem he would recommend a new dryer. The tech then installed parts and said I was good. Since yesterday I have dryer clothes and have barely any heat on high heat setting. There is a major problem and this dryer needs to be replaced completely. I have wasted so much time with this dryer and lost money at work. This is ridiculous and I will be calling to address this matter,1620712,SEARS (MI-3),9045 COPPER RIDGE DR,DAVISON,MI,APL,48423

Finally, late in the day, after the agreed upon time, & this technician still wasn’t here with no personal communication, we attempted to find out the reasoning to no avail & no way to talk to a person for an explanation.  So we rescheduled via the messaging provided & this time the technician did arrive & completed the repair.

This part arrived at the house. 3rd visit we took time off work to wait for the tech, we were not advised of time of arrival. The tech arrived, rang the doorbell once, waited a little over one minute then left. I literally seen him pull away. I had NO WAY of contacting anyone to have him come back. My only choice was to reschedule online. 4th appt was yesterday, he put in the part, only took a few minutes, said all was fully fixed. I made arrangements to work from home so I can make sure the technician doesn't ring the bell once & leave. I wasn't able to test it out until I got off work and the unit powers on but the cycle does not start. I had a lot of trouble contacting ANYONE again. Online via chat I was advised they couldn't help me because the order was marked completed and they no longer had access to the order & referred me back to AHS who is also difficult to get a hold of.

This was not correct and the suspension problem could have been easily diagnosed by pushing down on the washer drum and seeing that it continued to bounce when released. AHS had sears come back out however the appointment was repeatedly rescheduled late in the afternoon. This all began in may. My family was going out of town so we pushed the reschedule out until we were back. This was then rescheduled after no one showed up on the appointed day. Someone showed up the next time correctly diagnosed the issue, ordered the part, and we were scheduled for Monday for the repair. No one showed up on Monday and we were reschediled again to Tuesday. The issue was finally fixed satisfactorily but the number of times no one showed was ridiculous. The appointment window we were given was 8-5 every time so my wife or I were putting things off multiple days that we needed to get done waiting for someone to come that didn't ever show and then between 2 and 5 we'd get a text saying sorry we couldn't make it today, here are options for rescheduling.

Warranty company indicated most of the parts were not covered due to wear categorized as, ""abuse.""

I asked him how they make that determination when he came to install covered parts and he lied and said the warranty company makes those decisions. Warranty company indicated they rely solely on technician diagnostic.

The covered parts tech ordered were not all the parts needed to make repair and tech indicated his company would need to locate/research and make a second visit.

Tech never returned and sears continued to schedule appts. I took several days off work over the course of 6 weeks and tried to reach out to Gabriel on his work phone number he gave me. I was never able to get a hold of anyone at Sears and even the warranty company could not make contact.

In addition to the lack of communication, On the second visit to install the incorrect part, Gabriel removed the worn plastic part and did not replace it. My refrigerator door now opens and shuts worse than it did before I called Sears for service because it is now metal on metal. Gabriel also broke the lower plastic vent on the bottom of the refrigerator after failing to remove a screw and indicated he would bring a replacement with him the next time he returned. He never returned.

After 6 weeks of reschedules and no shows,  as well as service that left my Appliance in worse condition than it was before I scheduled service, I received an estimate in my inbox today that says I accepted the repair with forged initials in the acceptance box.

In addition to considering legal action, I wish I could give less than one star. There are very few companies in the valley that repair appliances and it's obvious that this company takes advantage of that facts to provide what is most likely the worst service I've ever experienced.

After 2 weeks without a fridge, we were told that he then needed to order new parts to fix the starter. After another 2 weeks, a new technician told us that he should have ordered another part because the compressor was now dead.

First my applicable went out on Wed May 21st and a tech was scheduled for May 23rd. The 23rd visit was cancelled by the company and pushed to May 27 for unknown reasons. On the 27th the technician told me he needed to order two parts. The parts came a day later and he came to install the parts on June 3rd. On the 3rd the tech told me that one of the parts was not compatible more to than likely because the fridge was 22 years old and a compatible part is no longer manufactured. (This is wear Sears went off the rails) The tech put in a research request to find the part to his research per company policy and an appt was automatically set for June 16th. Between the 3rd and the 16th I received no follow up from Sears on the research request until the tech called me on the 16th asking me if a part came to my house. I told him nothing came and I haven't heard from anyone. He told me sears' customer service is all AI so he wasn't surprised. He made a call to his ""VRS"" for research and then I got an actual email saying research was requested. Another part came then next day on the 17th. Guess what... It was wrong part again... The same wrong part. The tech came to my house a fourth time on the 19th to confirm the part was wrong. At this point he put in a NLA and npsc1 notice or request to my warranty company so the fridge could be replaced. I call my warranty company and they have no idea about this and tell me I need to wait on Sears to tell them they can't fix the damn fridge. We're at 4 weeks now people with no fix because I trusted my warranty company AHS and Sears to do their jobs. That was dumb of me. I contacted Sears to escalate 2x and by the grace of God I was able to talk to human being. They explained that the technician never entered a research request on June 3rd, he just entered notes. So nothing actually state until June 19th. Sears needs to get their act together. Finally on June 24th I call AHS and they were able to give my options to replace my fridge. I've gone a month without a fridge in the summer no less.

My review is on Sears customer service, to have waited almost a month to get my dryer repaired is very unprofessional. Their excuse was parts will not arrive on time which in fact I had the parts for two weeks prior to them coming on the 25th. 
My original appt was 6/4, which then got pushed to 6/19, which then again got pushed to 6/27 until I called y’all to complain about them it then got put to the 25th. 
If I would have bought the warranty through Lowe’s my dryer would have been fixed the following week of it going bad. 

I think American Home Shield should rethink how they go about doing contracts with companies that have no regard to a customer.

After my repair request was dispatched to Sears on 5/24, my service appointment was rescheduled three times at the end of the day when the service was supposed to be performed, which is incredibly inconvenient considering I work a full time job and have to make special arrangements to have someone there for the repair. I finally called about all the rescheduling and was informed that the appointment wasn’t even showing in their system but that she would set it up to dispatch a repair man. The repair man came on 6/2 and was helpful and diagnosed the issue, saying that they would have to search for the part from a third party vendor and if they didn’t receive the part within two weeks, they would replace my machine. It has been three weeks since that date and the repair has been rescheduled 10 times at sporadic dates, claiming that the part hasn’t been received yet sometimes rescheduling to a date prior to the one it was cancelling for. I’ve only been able to speak to one person from Sears, and that was following my initial complaint to AHS, and this is who informed me that their system wasn’t recognizing my initial appointments. When I call Sears, I’m directed to an automated system and when I reference the app, I’m told to call Sears for answers. Where can I get answers about this issue? It certainly isn’t from Sears.

Sears as a company needs to have the basic parts such as heating elements in stock..I still don't understand why this part had to be ordered, especially, when I communicated with the Al bot that the oven doesn't get hot and the heating element no longer turns orange/red.
Also, Sears need to narrow down their arrival window time from 9 hours, 8:00 am - 5:00 pm......to 4 hours.
A person should not have to take off an entire day because they don't know what time the repair person will srrive.

However, the process is terrible. First you provide a 9 hour window of when the tech may arrive. There seems to be no consideration of the customer's schedule and that they may have to work. I received a text at 12:22 PM on Saturday, June 14th stating the repair person would arrive at 12:37 PM. I rushed home from a bike ride, got ready and no repair person. He did not show until 2:00 PM. When questioned, he said he was at lunch. Once in my condo, he diagnosed the problems right away and was recommending a new refrigerator. However, he could not get a hold of anyone with Sears support to receive an authorization number and was on hold for 40-45 minutes. He is required to get an authorization number before he can officially proceed with the job. He was at my condo for over an hour. All in all that day, it took up close to 3 hours of my time without a resolution to a non working refrigerator. Because he could not get an authorization number, per Sears - it was like he was never here. I was required to reschedule the appointment. This made no sense since the repairman had been out here and already made the diagnosis. He was already here, why did he have to inconvenience me and come out to my condo again?? He knew the problem and could have submitted it without having to come back out. Per AHS/Sears, the next repair date was Tuesday, June 17th. I was informed by AHS that Sears would be at my place sometime between the hours of 8:00 AM and 5 PM - again a 9 hour window. This is terrible. Although for that day it didn't matter because no one called and no one came out. But, I was forced to be by my phone at all times. Once again I was on the phone with AHS and they said he would be out by 8:00 AM on Wednesday, June 18th and that I would receive a phone call when he was on his way. I waited 2 hours until 10 AM as I had to get to work. No one showed. At 1:30 PM the technician called and was at my gate. I was at work involved in meetings. There was no phone call ahead of time and I could not let him in as I was not at home. He let me know that the next available appointment was on July 9th!! This is ridiculous. Do you even realize that people have other commitments? This has been a huge inconvenience. A refrigerator is a major appliance that one cannot do without for very long. It's not a stove or a dishwasher. I can easily go without these. But a refrigerator in Florida is an absolute must. The customer service has been terrible. There is no way to talk or text with a real person. There has been no communication. My fridge has been out since the evening of June 11th, (reported to AHS on June 12th), (assigned to Sears on June 12th). My understanding is that there are only 3 techs in South Florida. My tech was coming from almost 2 hours away. Why wouldn't he call first to make certain that the customer can meet up with him? There were other problems, but these are the highlights. I grew up with Sears and have always liked the company. I hope this is something you can rectify and improve upon. American Home Shield has now assigned another company to come and repair my refrigerator and they are scheduled to come out tomorrow - Monday.

I think he got upset because the job was taking longer than he wanted it to.  I guess because it is a side by side refrigerator/freezer and he had difficulty pulling the refrigerator out by himself. He unclogged something from a piece of pipe, but was not able to get the refrigerator and freezer properly align back together.  He kept saying it was my fault as I have the responsibility to provide proper access.  I didn't know what he meant by that.  I told him I was 75 and have a left shoulder that I am going to have surgery on.  Did he think I was suppose to pull the refrigerator out by myself for him.  He said he wasn't coming back after he initially said this was a two-man job and would have to come back.  He also did not replace several screws he had taken out when he was trying to fix the leak.  I asked him to put the vegetable bins back in the refrigerator he had taken out and he told me it wasn't his responsibility.  He begrudgingly put the vegetable bins back in the refrigerator,  He stated I would have to find someone to align the refrigerator and freezer.  He was never coming back to my house and he was going to black list me.  Also when he first came into my home I told him that the refrigerator door no longer made a seal and I was not able to list both the leak and door seal as problems with the refrigerator on the computer list as it only allow me to list one thing that was wrong.  He left and never addressed door seal.  He was very unprofessional, did not show up on the day that was originally scheduled.

At approximately 20 minutes before the end of the appointment time period I received a text advising the technician was on his way. Then approximately 4 minutes after the end of the appointment time period ending, I received another text indicating my appointment was being rescheduled for the 18th. On the 18th my wife and I were here all day& after receiving a text that the technician was on his way, I checked the multiple times and we did did not see or hear anyone arrive or hear any knocks on either door. Then a few minutes after the technician was scheduled to arrive, I received another text update on the Sears appointment site indicating the technician had been here, but nobody was home. Within a minute of seeing this update I called AHS to complain & efforts were made to have the technician return. I was also provided a number to call to speak with a Sears customer service representative since there is none available in their email, text, or appointment site. I spoke to someone at Sears and was told the technician would return on Wednesday. That did not occur, and we were rescheduled for the following day (Thursday, today). I called and requested to be placed at the beginning of the service schedule, and also requested that the technician call to make sure we didn’t have a repeat of the previous day. Unfortunately neither of those requests were accommodated. However, today I even opened an exterior door to a breezeway to allow the technician to walk right up to our back door.  However, the technician did not walk in and knock, and I did not even receive a text message notification of the technician in his way. I did receive another text email, but the email did not arrive until just before I checked the Sears Appointment Site indicating the technician had been here, but nobody was home again! I immediately called Sears Customer Service and expressed my frustration at approximately 3:15PM and I was advised they would send the technician back out. That did not occur & at about 5:05PM I called AHS and requested this service request be transferred to another vendor.

I sternly refused and he didn't explain what he wanted me to see that could only be seen if I got down on the floor.  The tension mounted, he called someone and spoke in Spanish,  replaced the freezer door, gathered his stuff and stormed out.

He may be a competent tech but his mannerism is a unprofessional attempt to intimidate and cast blame.

Therefore for over a months period of time we are without a refrigerator!!!!!  Would you want to be without a refrigerator in better than 80 degree weather?? Living out of a cooler?
Sears AI experience sucks!! The AI BITCH/BOT is just that, a BITCH. It cannot resolve any issues. Oh, I can reschedule you ! Is this date ok?  Can I talk to a live representative?? “No, we do not have those available!! Absolutely piss poor customer service!  And calling AHS can’t do anything to help the issue. “There’s nothing we can do”. Well this is your contractor!!  Oh and he tells me that he is the only sears repair guy on the west side. Meaning the whole west side of Washington state. West of Seattle!! So again, my experience with AHS Has been absolutely costly!!  Laundry at a laundromat, dishwasher that took forever to get repaired!! And now refrigerator that failed and took over a month to get repaired!!  WHILE THE PARTS ORDERED WERE HERE IN TWO DAYS!!!!!!!!

 I asked for an early date with the AI B#%~*BOT. ABSOLUTELY a nightmare interaction with the AI BOT that AHS hired. 

All of the dates I was given were just ghost dates!! Causing me to lose at least 24 hours of my time!!  75 dollars an hour adds up to a lot of personal loss. $1800!! Oh wait that’s the cost of a sub par replacement!!  Which AHS would have given us maybe $1100. To replace something that cost well over$2000. How does $109 for eleven years, $14000 help at all other than AHS’s profits!!!!!

Dealing with that selection was easy, but delivery, installation, and haul-away arrangements for the new unit were a nightmare. We finally ended up cancelling the delivery and agreeing to take the $ so we could just deal with a reliable vendor in our area where purchase, delivery, installation, and haul-away are arranged at the same time through the same source. We paid a very high premium for this warranty service, but it is not worth the headaches this one interaction has caused. Your frustrating policies and “hoops” to get things accomplished will result in non-renewal of our AHS contract, sadly.

I was given an 8am-5pm window for service - effectively taking my entire day - TWICE. Technician showed up at 4:30pm to diagnose the issue. A part was to be ordered and the repair appointment was nearly TWO WEEKS later. Two weeks without a working refrigerator. 

Second appointment was also a 9 hour window and HE NEVER SHOWED UP. Ten minutes before the end of the appointment window, we received an email saying our appointment had been rescheduled. We didn’t even receive the courtesy of a phone call  I called to find out what was going on after having WASTED 9 hours waiting on the repair person and was told multiple lies about the date change. First was that the rescheduled date was my original appointment time; I have multiple texts saying otherwise. The second lie was that it was cancelled because I never confirmed delivery of the part (sometime I was never asked to do), but the call representative confirmed we got delivery on May 31 - if they could see that why did I need to confirm? 

He finally showed up two days later, replaced the part, told me “it should be working now” (which left little confidence in his repair), and left the trash from the part in my kitchen. 

We’ve had the misfortune to have three appliances break recently. The other service companies gave us a two hour window, showed up on time, and left the area clean. They were respectful of my time, something Sears was not. I wasted TWENTY hours waiting on the repair. ",1563162,SEARS (VA),101 RICHMOND WAY,CARROLLTON,VA,APL,23314

The technician responded quickly on the initial call.
The technician worked well and efficiently to install dampers on washer.

The bad:
Asked to provide detail of issue upon initial contact so that technician could have parts ready to be installed; technician showed up on initial response and needed to order parts delaying the repair.
Upon parts receipt technician rescheduled time that did not work for our schedule so we needed to reschedule again, delaying the repair.
When technician returned for the parts install it was realized that more parts needed to be ordered. Technician installed received parts and placed order for additional parts, delaying the repair.
Once parts received rescheduled the next available for the technician to come install; on day of install technician claimed that we were unavailable/refused service and provided a picture of our house as proof of our unavailability; we were at the house all day waiting for the technician and the picture provided was not even our house; We were forced to reschedule, and the next available appointment was an additional two weeks away, further delaying the repair.

When he came and we looked at the part we found that it was a refurbished part that was broken in 2 places, luckily the technician had extra parts in his truck. The text message for the last cancelled appointment indicated it was cancelled because the part would not arrive on time when the part had been sitting in my house for over a week and when I called Sears customer service the woman indicated no one could come because there were no technicians in my area.

Given he was intoxicated and asked to sign a document and I asked what clauses I am signing for he couldn’t explain or validate that. He signed on my behalf and left the scene. This itself is unlawful and a bad experience.

Given he did not open and investigated my dryer so I was doubtful of his investigation. So I did my own research and bought the most common part for such heat element failure (A fuse of $5 from amazon). 

Lorenzo (2nd person) came after 2 weeks and told the ordered part was wrong item. Confirmed my ordered fuse was needed to fix the heat element. He fixed the dryer. I gave one extra star just because of Lorenzo (2nd technician)’s good experience.

Now the AHS staff were nice but could not do anything to help me and my service request have been dispatched to a new company but I have not even heard from them at all ",1558822,SEARS (TUSCALOOSA-3),7012 COOPERSTOWN CIR,COTTONDALE,AL,APL,35453

I want to point out. Is it doesn't mattered how detailed information I have given AHS representatives seemingly none of them. Actually write the message down verbatim. Or even get the idea correct where the next agent can understand what's going on. So I have to start from day one and explain each and every event to catch.

I had a great experience with the technician who came out to repair my microwave through my American Home Warranty service. They were prompt, professional, and very knowledgeable. The issue was diagnosed quickly, and the repair was handled efficiently with no hassle.

The technician was courteous, respectful of my home, and took the time to explain what had gone wrong and how it was fixed. It’s such a relief to have things working again without the stress or long wait times you sometimes expect with warranty claims.

Very satisfied with the service and grateful for the smooth process. Thank you for the great work!

AMHS setup a service provider to come out last week. I took the day off work ( cost me $400) and my appointment was canceled in the afternoon for no reason.  I had to take another day off thus week ( again it cost me $400) and no one called me prior in the day to say what time the service tech would be here!!
When he did call & let me know of the time he'd be here, he was here as told and did a great job and highly recommend!
The main problem I have AMHS, is that Im routed to a call center in Asia, can't hardly understand them and we're no help!! I asked to be transferred to customer service in the YS and not only they couldn't,  but didn't have a number I could call. This is Very Poor customer service. Get me a person in the US I can understand and can help me better.
I've been an American Homeshield customer fir over 4 years and had recommend you to other friends, but Im now looking for a different provider that has customer service based in the US and won't cause me all the problems I've had with service problem.  You should at least reimburse the $125 we had to pay for the problems you caused.

Our frustration stems from the fact that we reported this same issue back in March, and at that time, we were told there was nothing wrong with the dishwasher.
Unfortunately, on May 19th, we returned home from a 10-day vacation to find our kitchen flooded—caused by the very same dishwasher, which hadn’t even been turned on. Clearly, there was an underlying issue that was either missed or not properly addressed during the initial service call.
As a result, we now face significant damage to our flooring, which we are being forced to replace at our own expense. This situation could have been avoided had the original problem been properly diagnosed and repaired. We are now dealing with a much larger issue and are requesting meaningful support from our home warranty company, which we believe should take responsibility for this outcome.

But a SEARS technician came to my home, diagnosed a problem we have with our washer, and ordered parts. When different technicians came to do the repair, they came up with their own diagnosis (which was actually: there is no problem), and left — and still charged for the visit!  Why would we have called for a repair if there was no problem?  

The reason I say that AHS is at least partly the problem, is I explained this to a representative on the phone while the techs were still at our house, and they sent them home anyway, without giving me any kind of plan for resolving our issue (and for allowing me to be charged.)

This is the second separate request we've put in for our washer. (Why wasn't it fixed the first time?) Also, we have another service request in process that AHS is not handling adequately either. 

The warranty would be great if it were actually resulting in repairs to our broken appliances. Isn't that what the warrantee is for?

Sears scheduled an appointment for MAY 17, originally, though no one had come out to ""DIAGNOSE"" the problem.  Then after ""SEVERAL"" TEXTS and/or EMAILS (about a week) asking for serial/model numbers and asking me to tell them the issue I was having with the washer, the ""troubleshooting team"" figured a part was needed.  So, I was RESCHEDULED for MAY 23 (because the part had to be ordered.)  On MAY 23 (11 days later), the technician came--but the part that had been ordered was the WRONG PART!  So the technician said he would order the part needed, and he scheduled us for MAY 27.  Then, I received an email or text saying they had RESCHEDULED me to, I believe MAY 30, then JUNE 6,  because the part would not be back in time for the repair that had been rescheduled for MAY 27.  HOWEVER,  I DID  RECEIVE THE PART ON MAY 27!  I CALLED Sears' number on MAY 27, and the automated service allowed me to reschedule to an ''EARLIER"" date--MAY 28!  So why was I being emailed and texted that it would be MAY 30, and then June 6???? MAY 27, I called AHS and asked the CSR to reach out to Sears on my behalf.  When AHS called Sears on MAY 27, it was ""confirmed"" that JUNE 28 was the scheduled date for the technician to come out to install the part(s).  I didn't believe it until Michael, the technician, called on MAY 28 to say that he was on his way to our house.  WEDNESDAY, MAY 28 was the first time we had use of our washer since requesting service to it on MAY 12.  

This is why I gave Sears the rating of 1!  This kind of service is unacceptable; and you, AHS, I hope will hold your contractors more accountable for better service to your customers, considering the $112 monthly fee AND $100 per service call I pay. . . not to mention customer loyalty . . . we have been AHS customers for how many years.  Is customer satisfaction important anymore????? 

I feel that Sears was looking more at ""convenience"" to them instead of ""customer service.""  They did not send a technician out to diagnose the problem . . . but TEXTED me at least 5 times asking for either the serial number and model number OR asking ""me to tell them the problem.""  Then they told me the ""troubleshooting team"" would diagnose the problem and I guess order the part they figured was needed, so the technician would have the part when he arrived.  Theoretically, that sounds good; but, I the ""old school way"" of the technician coming out, inspecting the appliance, making a diagnosis, ordering the part(s), then returning to install part(s) was USUALLY a 2-week ordeal; but this has been the MOST FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE I have ever had with an AHS repair request!

When the tech arrived on 5/5/25 he stated that the parts were incorrect and that he would have to return on the 12th. I explained that I could only be there until 12:30 pm on that date and he stated he would make me his first stop. On the 12th I hadn’t heard anything from him up until about 10:30 am so I texted to check on his ETA and he stated that he couldn’t be there until the afternoon so I rescheduled for the 19th. On the 19th I received a text at approximately 2:30 pm stating they had to cancel. The part the tech had ordered had arrived in the mean time so I ended up installing it myself and the dryer works properly now. In conclusion, I had to use three vacation days to accommodate Sears because the time frame they give for repairs is 8am to 5 pm, and they never completed the repair. They also state that you will get called in the morning to verify the times they will arrive and that never happened.

I rarely take the time to leave reviews, but this experience was so incredibly frustrating that I feel compelled to share it — not just for my own sake, but as a warning to others.

I submitted a service ticket to have my washer machine repaired, paying a $125 service charge upfront. Sears Parts Services scheduled the first appointment for May 16, only to cancel it last minute due to “unforeseen circumstances.” Frustrating, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.

They then rescheduled the appointment for May 23, with a massive 8 AM to 5 PM window — meaning I had to completely rearrange my entire day to ensure I was home if and when the technician showed up.But guess what?

Rating would be 5 Star because the final technician was competent knowledgeable, and got the job done. 

But the timeline was extremely long and we had to call Sears and American Home Shield many many times. A big waste of our life. We were without a washer, almost 2 months. it cost us over $100 per week to go to the laundromat. (and that is just for the use of the washers.)

Prior to the final visit in which the problem was fixed, we had three missed appointments by Sears, which was very difficult for us. I am a substitute teacher and I did not accept jobs on those three days because I was waiting for Sears. That is lost income to me.

Prior to yesterday, Sears sent technicians on one visit who just walked in and walked back out. Rather than see whether or not the water pump which we had in hand would fix the problem; they  kept talking about needing a new panel… And the panel worked flawlessly. it sounded like and it was an excuse.

The first visit by a technician was good and he ordered three parts. Only two came in which meant Sears never was willing to look at the problem.

So the first and last visits were good and the four in between were very poor. No one was willing to “work the problem.“ They wanted to have AHS cash out our washer and/or replace it. By being stubborn, we have saved American Home Shield a lot of money. While we ourselves are out a great deal of money because Sears would not come and try to fix the unit. Had they tried, the unit would’ve been fixed April 15. This would have saved us $500 in laundromat fees.

Strongly recommend American Home Shield work with Sears to improve their service delivery.. Generally we believe Sears is very good, but this has been a poor experience. 

Again, the first and last technicians were very good. In between we had one visit with people who would not even try to help and three visits where Sears no showed. ",1562042,SEARS (VISALIA),500 S VERDE VISTA ST,VISALIA,CA,APL,93277

He said I needed to pay to have him come back inside!! Horrible, horrible man! And I called sears to complain and they only offer a Robot ai representative!!!!

I called Sears and they could not match my phone # or email address to an order. Frustrated and very disappointed, I called AHS and spoke with a man named Prince who helped get the work order to Sears. They scheduled a service appointment for 5/12. Mid-day on the 12th, I received a text telling me that due to unforseen circumstances they were not able to come to the house and that I could choose between 4 dates to reschedule the repair appointment to 5/15. The same thing happened  on the 15th. I called Sears and requested info that a receptionist/ call center could not provide. Extremely frustrated, I told her to CANCEL my AHS membership immediately. So what I am telling you is that this is the WORST service experience I have ever had. Absolutely horrible.

This time I just received a text and a email which were not timely. In the past, technicians would show up and call and would not knock on the door. So if you did not answer the phone call you would be considered not home. For this service request I did not get that phone call so I literally had to physically check every hour if the service technician was outside. The estimated arrival time for the technician in the system said 1:15 PM but the check did not come until around 4:30 PM which is expected. The only problem was that the technician seem to be impatient and rushed.

Only 2.5 hrs before the visit, could I get an indication of when the repair person would arrive - and that required me to constantly poll the Sears website to see if the visit time would change.

Did his job when he installed the parts and put everything back together there was a problem with the machine power coming on. He said maybe circuit breaker so i checked not it!  I suggested maybe he didn’t hook something back up?  Then he was checking outlets and other things. Finally he took panel off again found da problem n hooked it up. He then informed me that the outlet was pulled away from da wall which I commented that the last tech that was here pulled it out while pulling dryer out from wall.  He then replied.
 “Why would he pull it so hard that it would do that!  I then replied “I don’t know i’m just telling you how it happened”.  He wasn’t offering to fix it so he shouldn’t be commenting or questioning me how it happened.

My appointment was scheduled out for TWO weeks. The day of the repair I had to take off work because SEARS gave a time frame of EIGHT hours. I lost a days pay. When the repair person showed up, he did not have the part necessary to make the repair. He spent more time in my bathroom than he did working on my dryer. He turned my dryer on, asked to use my restroom, then 10 minutes later, came out of my restroom , turned the dryer off and announced that he could not make the repair because they do not carry parts on their trucks. He scheduled another appointment for two weeks out. I called AHS and reported this - was told the repair person would be back the next day to complete the repair and no one showed up BUT the dryer part was delivered. On the second day scheduled, I again had to take off work because again Sears gave an EIGHT hour window for the repair. AGAIN, I lost a day’s pay. I received a message from Sears that the repair person would arrive between 7:35 and 9 am. He did not show up until 4:40 pm. He was in my home for less than 15 minutes making the repair. I tried to contact Sears before lunch when the repair person missed the window indicated in the message. I could not get in touch with anyone because their “contact” system is completely automated. My only choices in their system was to cancel or reschedule. I could not talk to anyone actual person. This was a TERRIBLE experience for me - I was forced to lose TWO days pay and I’m sure I will be charged a service fee which just basically means I lose MORE money. I’m seriously considering cancelling my policy with AHS - it would be cheaper for me to just pay out of pocket for appliance repair rather than lose my monthly premium, wages when I have to take off work all day (multiple days) and service fees for crappy service. I definitely WILL NOT be recommending anyone pay for a policy such as this. ",1558082,SEARS (TX-75)-3,3803 REDWOOD TRL,MARSHALL,TX,APL,75672

After receiving the belt only, the Samantha AI stated there was an error with the parts order for the speed sensor. Upon calling Sears and talking to agents multiple times, I had two failed escalations and eventually told they would not do anything because they had 10 more business days to find the part before it would be marked as not repairable. 

After the 48 hours required from the first escalation without a response, I called back to learn the escalation had not even been seen. On my third call, I was told about the 10 more business day thing. I checked the Sears parts website and they had the item we needed in stock with delivery expected in 48 hours. It still took more than that before the part arrived. 

In the future, I will be doing phone requests for appliance repairs because even the Sears techs are vocal about how bad the Sears system is with getting parts these days.

App shows they will be there at a certain time and that time passes without updates.  1st appointment couldn’t fix, needed parts. 2nd appointment was a no show and no call either. 3rd appointment was told he couldn’t fix because the refrigerator was frozen (exactly what the call was for) and his steamer was broken.  Called AHS and spoke with Erica who agreed it was time to find another vendor.  Nope, assigned to Sears again. 4th appointment finally got Christopher who was courteous and seemed knowledgeable. He is in no way why I rated one star.  At this point refrigerator seems to be fixed.  There is no way to speak to a live person at Sears.  Automated only. AI assistant unable to help.

After two weeks I called AMS and was told that Sears had the part and was given an installation date. The date came and went with no update from Sears or AHS. I called AHS again and was told by the agent that the part should come to me. This is going on four weeks. After several more days, I finally reached someone in AHS that followed up on the order status. They informed me that AHS was cancelling the repair, and was going to replace the range. I got another ""part is on order"" that day. It appeared to me that there was not communication between AHS and Sears regarding the status of my repair.

This tech said that my vent needed to be cleaned when it fact it didn’t but I had to pay $277 to a company through AHS since the person came to clean my vent.

The tech ordered parts for the dryer that he admitted did not need to be installed on the dryer as the dryer did not need them. Such as the thermostat and cutoff pieces. The tech tossed those parts in his tool bag so I am not sure what happened to those parts.

When the tech was testing the dryer the front panel board lit up like crazy and when he asked me if it did that before I said no. The tech then stated that he didn’t touch that but yet he took my entire dryer apart so he had to of touched/unplugged everything in the front to remove the drum. Once the tech realized his worked may have caused another issue he claimed it was all fixed and then quickly left.

He said there was trash and that I can throw the trash away in a nasty manner. He then went outside and forged my signatures on his final documents as I never seen those forms or approved anything. ",1562302,SEARS (BALTIMORE),637 NOLLMEYER RD,BALTIMORE,MD,APL,21220

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the poor service I have received from American Home Shield and Sears Repair Services. I have experienced a whole week of runaround, characterized by a lack of care, poor sublet contractors, and terrible communication from american home shield and sears repair services. There was speakerphone call in front of me involving the  sears repair technician and an American Home Shield representative. During this call, the replacement of my unit was approved.

I have since learned that the notes and the phone call record of this approval are currently missing.

Could you please assist in locating these missing records or advise on the next steps to proceed with the approved unit replacement?

Despite my daily calls to get updates, all I have been told is that American Home Shield has not received a report from their contractor. I was later informed that the report was incomplete.

Furthermore, I have had people in the escalation department hang up on me. On multiple occasions, I have been told that no manager or team leads are available to speak with me.

I expect a prompt resolution to this issue and a significant improvement in the level of service I am receiving.",1563342,SEARS (KENNEWICK),2410 BOULDER ST,RICHLAND,WA,APL,99352

The tech who came out on 4/18 was very nice, diagnosed the problems and ordered parts, suspension rods and actuator, which came over the weekend.  

I had a repair appointment for 4/22....and it was a no show.  The appointments for 4/23 and 4/28 were also no shows.  3 days of cancelling  my schedule, and waiting.  About noon each day I got a text saying they were not arriving after all.

Finally yesterday, 4/30, Joshua arrived and checked out my washer.  He said the detailed analysis the first tech left, did not appear on my work order.  I SAW the first tech leave details.  At any rate, Joshua said one of the washer legs was not fully down in position, which is why the spinning was not good,  and that I did not need the suspension parts.  He took those with him.
He installed the actuator and ran a test load of towels, which seemed fine.  The washer does appear to be fixed, which I do appreciate.  I can understand having to cancel ONE appointment, but I think 3 cancellations is not good.",1561052,SEARS (MI-2),930 CHERRYWOOD CIR,PORTLAND,MI,APL,48875

The AHS website gave us one date, Sears text messages and emails gave us a different date and then it turned out to be a third date. Once the appointment was confirmed (for a 3rd time) we received a bunch of requests for information about the problem we were experiencing with our washer. We provided them with pictures and information. We were told at that time it was so the tech would have parts on hand to fix the issue when he arrived. When the technician came, he knew none of that information and stated that he was not there to fix the issue only to diagnose it which he did, and then we had to wait another 5 days for it to finally be repaired. Again, we had to confirm our appointment another 2 or 3 times. Prior to the first visit we were given a general window of between 8am and 5pm but received no updates on when the technician would arrive despite being told that we would. He showed up at 4:45 with no prior warning. When you call the number that American Home Shield tells you to call for Sears it goes to a computer system. There is no way to talk to a person to find out any information. Lastly, and probably the most frustrating is that the technician left our machine a mess, scratched up and oil/dirt all over it. This was a very disappointing experience, especially considering every other experience we have had as been good and the service providers have been good.

The only reason I had to use Sears home service Alameda was because it was the one American home shield warranty uses. If I had a choice I would not use them ever!  I was rescheduled 7 times and 6 weeks later.  If Sears had done things correctly in the first place I would have only been out a washer 2 weeks max ( that's taking into consideration the back ordered parts).  What they should have done was send out a tech, assess problem,  order needed parts, schedule a follow appointment and do repairs on that second appointment. 
No instead they scheduled me for an appointment with a tech, then asked. Via text what the problem was ( I am not an expert) sears took a guess as to what the problem was and ordered parts they think might be needed.  BUT did not tell me it was to be delivered to my house and I would have to wait til said part was at my house to confirm a tech would come.  Meanwhile a tech arrives for the first scheduled appointment made by sears and the Tech did not look at the machine because his system said I did not have warranty! Hence the second appointment and then third fourth up to 7th appointment.  The actual tech was nice. The company needs better management. And until that happens American Home Shield Warranty needs to reconsider doing business with the.m. let me tell you I am really close to cancelling my warranty and finding another.

He said he needed a new panel and he would order and come back.  He left, the electrical panel door outside was left open. Unbeknownst to me he had popped the Gcfi. I had to call an electrician. He came back  with  the wrong part. Third time he came with the part and hooked it up. Worked for 1 day (he installed it by watching Utube no wonder) The next time I used the micro it made a loud popping sound and turned off.  Popped the gcfi. I called AHS and by this time 30 days went by so AHS charged me yet another 125.00. The sent out a guy from Sears. He ordered a new part and capped some live wires. The part shipped to my house and he came back to install it and replaced a fuse. Worked fine  but it made a  loud popping sound and most likely there is still a live wires inside.  He came back (by this time it’s late March). Tied off more loose wires. I called AHS again! He broke 2 appointments ( never showed up). Needless to say, I did not pay the premium. AHS then called me and told me I hadn’t paid the 124.99 premium. I said  “rightly so” as the microwave still doesn’t  work and to cancel the warranty. They made another appointment which I declined. I paid the for over 6 years. I can’t imagine what would have happened if the problem was the furnace.

This service has been rescheduled quite a bit of times and we have been three weeks without a stove. I have three children and this is not fair as I pay you all on time each month I asked for them to waive the hundred dollar fee and the girl told me flat out no and then she also told me flat out know that I could not speak with a manager. This is not good business. I am very disappointed as I’ve been with this service for almost 20 some odd years. I am almost forced to file a Better Business Bureau complaint against your company because you are not being transparent of the services. Your vendors contact information is terrible. Everything should be on touch customer service and not speaking with a computer all the time since you did not care about me at this point I m may have to follow an attorney general complaint,1562762,SEARS (CINCINNATI-2),1920 TRUITT AVE,CINCINNATI,OH,APL,45212

This was a product malfunction and water never leaked onto that to cause it to come off, ever. This is a repeat problem with several different dishwashers because the glue that holds that part loosens up from the steam and heat from the dishwasher. Water only got in from splashing in from the dishwasher once that piece became unglued. This is a product malfunction and was not caused by the operator of the machine. He also came in both times on the phone for extended periods of time and i couldn't really talk to him bc of this. He did at least apologize for this yesterday. The first appointment it was very awkward and uncomfortable bc he was on the phone the whole time while working on the dishwasher. It would be more professional to handle that before going into clients homes. Honestly he did fix the issue and I feel it was done in a timely manner so that's all I really care about but blaming me for the cause of the problem and only telling my husband this was pretty unprofessional. Especially when my husband doesn't use the dishwasher so he doesn't remember things like the control board seal coming off on its own. I could've told him that but he chose to tell my husband the problem and would barely even talk to me. Why didn't he tell me this at the first service appointment when my husband wasn't there.

Bronco was fantastic and I would love to be able to rate him separately with 5 stars. Frank, I would give negative stars to, if I could. 

Frank was my initial technician in early March. I had previously removed the kickplate to the dishwasher and the little metal box that covers the wiring harness. I did not put them back on because I decided to use my home warranty and I knew the repair technician would need them off. Frank came out and determined that either the UI board and/or the main board were faulty. He ordered both parts and set a date for the return visit to install. 

Frank returned for the installation. When he was installing the mainboard, he noticed that the polarity of the dishwasher wires had been hooked up incorrectly by the original dishwasher installers. So, he took the time to fix that. After he installed the mainboard and the dishwasher had power, he declared the dishwasher fixed and did not install the UI board. He left without putting the metal cover for the wiring harness back on nor the dishwasher kickplate. I was a little annoyed, but decided it wasn't that big a deal if my dishwasher was fixed. However, the dishwasher started to beep randomly a week later. 

I put in a return ticket. Bronco was the technician for the return ticket, he could not identify any issues because the dishwasher wasn't being weird when he was here. Then a week or so went by and the dishwasher completely died again. I placed another return ticket. 

Bronco returned. I told him that I had done some googling and the consensus online seemed to be a bad UI board. I informed Bronco that Frank had initially ordered one, but then didn't install it. Bronco unplugged the UI board from the mainboard, gave it 30 seconds and plugged it back in. The UI board lit up and he agreed that the UI board appeared to be the problem. We scheduled a follow-up. 

Frank was the follow-up technician. He insisted that the UI board couldn't possibly be the problem (However, on his initial visit he thought that it could be). He said, ""it has to be the mainboard."" (which he previously replaced). He also told me that I might need to do a software update. When I told him it wasn't a smart dishwasher, he proceeded to tell me that all GE dishwashers are smart and have an ethernet cable connection underneath. (I was very puzzled by his response because if you have to connect the dishwasher to the internet via ethernet, that's not ""smart,"" nor something the dishwasher owner would reasonably do on their own.) He saw that the dishwasher control board currently had power and asked me how that was possible. I explained that, on its own, it had been coming on and doing the ""wake-up chime,"" then turning off randomly throughout the day. It then stopped turning on at all. When Bronco came out the week before, he disconnected the UI board, reconnected it, and it had power. So, Bronco ordered the UI board, and the dishwasher continued to have power since that visit.  

Frank attempted to start but couldn't remember how to remove the dishwasher door. He explained that he needed to take off the door to get to the UI board. He didn't bother googling it; he just started looking all around the dishwasher for ""clues."" I retrieved my user manual stuff to see if I could find the instructions for door removal. I looked through the installation instructions and user manual and didn't find the information. At that point, I commented that if he needed to access the left side of the dishwasher to remove the door that he would probably have to pull it out. Then he immediately started working on pulling the dishwasher out instead of searching online for directions to remove the door.

First, he removed my trim boards. Then, he decided that the front leveling feet were extended too far and he needed to retract them to move the dishwasher. He tried to loosen the pressure on the front left foot and struggled with it. Then he told me that the leveling foot was stripped and he couldn’t get it to go up or down. He babbles on about how he thinks there was a service bulletin about the screws stripping on GE dishwasher feet. At this point, I looked down at my folder of user manuals and realized that I'd missed a small folded up piece of paper. I opened it up and it was the directions to take the door off. I looked at it and saw that it was not nearly as complicated as Frank had presumed. It looked like you only needed to release the door on the right side with an Allen wrench and the door would come off. It seemed pretty easy to me, and I handed him the directions.

He started to fiddle with the wiring harness, and the dishwasher randomly turned on. He then asked, ""Does the dishwasher randomly turn on?""  I replied, ""Yes, that's the whole problem."" He pulled on the wires a bit, and the ground came loose. He fixed that and decided he needed to make a call.

When he came back inside, he said, ""I'm pretty sure it was just the loose ground wire causing all these problems. When I rewired the polarity the first time I was out, I must not have gotten the ground tight enough, which is weird because I did tug on it."" He continued, ""I think that retightening the ground will fix all your problems."" He explained that since the installer had switched the polarity on the machine wires, that caused the initial problem with the main board. Then because he apparently didn't get the ground wire secure enough, the machine had been getting power surges causing all the random beeping and messed up the new control board. He insisted that the problem could not be the UI board and if he were to replace the UI board he would have to pull the dishwasher completely out. (I was pretty sure that wasn't true based on the directions). He continued to tell me that the UI board they ordered from Amazon, ""is crap anyway."" He informed me that the person he called told him that if it was too difficult to remove the dishwasher to perform the repair, I would need to have the dishwasher pulled out before the appointment. He continued by telling me that he bet I won't have any problems now that he re-secured the wires. He also said that since the feet were stripped, I would need to get a shim to shove under the foot to keep the dishwasher in position. He decided to reorder the main control board and reschedule the repair visit. Two hours after Frank left, the dishwasher started to randomly chime again, and it was completely dead by the final return visit. 

Thankfully, Bronco was the technician for the last installation visit. When he arrived, I gave him the new parts. He asked if the dishwasher had power and I told him it was plugged in but was again ""dead."" I told him that if he didn't need my help right away I needed to use the restroom. When I returned (less than 5 minutes later) the door was off the dishwasher and lying on the floor. Bronco was messing with the feet of the dishwasher because all the racks kept sliding forward. He told me the back feet were a little bit too high, so he retracted those and re-adjusted the front feet without any issues. He was able to replace the UI board and went ahead and replaced the main board that Frank ordered. He also put the wire cover and kickplate back on the dishwasher (Which Frank had not done). The dishwasher is now, finally acting like it is supposed to. 

Everything Frank insisted was next to impossible to fix, Bronco took care of with relative ease and no complaints. I felt like when Frank talked to me, he spoke with a certitude that was deliberately trying to ""gas light"" me. He insisted that the UI board couldn't be the problem, even though Bronco and I had agreed it was. He blustered about how difficult it was to get the door off; however the written directions didn't concur with his conclusion. He couldn't adjust the feet after he messed with them and decided the feet were defective. Conversely, Bronco was calm and reserved, and he fixed all the issues quietly and quickly.

My last repair was April 14 and that was right after 2 back to back appointments canceled by Sears the day off. It’s taken over a dozen appointments to get this refrigerator fixed and I’m still a little iffy about the last repair.  Sears gives you an arrival window of 8 AM to 5 PM and the morning of you get a 1-2hr arrival window.  If you’re not the first appointment, your arrival window will continue to slip throughout the day. This happened on three different occasions I had the arrival window slip past 5 PM then the tech would just cancel on me.  This after I had already made arrangements to stay home that day instead of going into work. Absolutely infuriating. Trying to call Sears is a nightmare as well. The automated telephone loop will hang up on you once you reach a dead end of questions trying to speak to a human who can help you. After 6 weeks of calling I finally found entering an incorrect work order number gets you to a person. Entering the correct work order just tells you your appointment time then hangs up on you ir send you to the main menu. On two different occasions, Sears sent the wrong part and forgot to order a part needed so appointments had to be moved due to their lack of preparation.

Then he came back out and was extremely rude to my elderly mother and said he was told not to complete the work without an additional service fee and it was within the 30 day window. Another waste of time and another day of work it cost me.  He then lied and said he came to my house at a later date and fixed the previous repair when he never showed up. There's no local number to call and complain to which is crazy. I reviewed his work and never received any communication about him lying. Problem is still there over a year later on a different appliance. Tom is a liar and a thief and charged you for work he never completed.

Because Charles is completely incompetent and has not fixed the fridge in FOUR trips out here. Each time he says it's something different and orders parts and then it's still not fixed.  I have been without a fridge since February. All Charles does is google the problem, call Samsung and then order parts that still don't work. The last time he completely contradicted what he said the time before and then told us to ""wait 72 hrs for it to settle it's self in"". In that 72hrs no one called to see if it was working properly but he closed out the ticket. We have since kept a log of the fridge temperatures and days.  It fluctuates wildly from safe to unsafe temperatures.
I have not even asked for replacement cost of my lost food in this time (cause he said it was fixed and we believed him and put the food back in the fridge) or the fridge I had to buy while waiting for parts multiple times. 
I do not think he's competent or able to fix the fridge and hell would freeze over before I would recommend Sears in Olympia to anyone.",1563332,SEARS (OLYMPIA-3),12841 BALD HILL RD SE,YELM,WA,APL,98597

Then they didn't want to know about that service date any more, they just changed the service date and told us that no one would come until we had called in to let them know that we had received the parts that had been ordered. When we got three packages all on the same day with parts, I called them (at a number the last guy have given me and said it was his direct line - but it had the auto message as the previous number had), I was on hold for at least 20 mins until someone answered. We told him we had parts but didn't know if it was all of them, and I wanted to give him part numbers, so he could let me know if we still needed any. But he wouldn't let me do that and said that we had all the parts but one - the heating element and that I needed to call once we had received that. We waited several days but did not receive any more parts. I looked up what a dryer heating element would look like and we did already have that - came that first day with all the other parts. I tried to call the day before the service appointment to let them know we had the part - as they had told me I had to do - but the auto answering message was slightly different and did not give me a chance to talk to anyone. It did tell me that my appt was confirmed for the next day. They did come today and fixed the dryer - so I'm happy with the work that was done - just not the phone system.

One time they cancelled an hour and a half before the end of the 11 hour window they gave me. No respect for my time whatsoever.  Interestingly enough, I am expected to proved a 24 hour notice of cancellation, it would be nice if ALL parties adhered to this.

My fridge was staying at 53 degrees and the freezer was at 33. The freezer lights stopped working and the ice machine would not produce any lights. I make a service request online. And pick a date. Technician comes out on time march 18. And the technician states the only issue is the ice machine. The lights not working and the temp is normal. He ordered what he stated was a mother board. So I was hoping it was going to fix more than the ice issue. Setup another appointment for the repair on the 24th. Which was canceled and than rescheduled for the 25th. Than same thing for the 26th than again for the 28th than again for the 29th. Each one of these days they give a time of 8-5 so my wife took off work each day. That would be Monday Tuesday Wednesday and friday. We didn’t have to take off Saturday. It is now going on Friday of the following week and no one has been back to my house. I have called and spent hours on the phone with the company working my way up the chain. And no one is helpful. What is the point in having a home warranty if what you have warrantied doesn’t ever get fixed.

First of all they scheduled my service with no direct point of time at Sears. For example the customer service representative kept sending me automated text that displayed a time that was 8am-5:00 pm or 7 am-6pm. On two separate days. It is frustrating waiting all day for a tech to show up. On the first time appointment was setup no one showed up from Sears after I waited half the day. A tech named Sayed Faroz came to my home finally  today. I explained what I had been experiencing with my appliance. He checks it out and when he began to diagnose he was not considerate when emptying water from my refrigerator pouring it sloppily into my sink. I removed my dish pan and items, due to him making a mess. As he was checking out my water dispenser I stated to him how slow it pours out ice and water. He states to me that cannot be true. I told him the water and ice dispenses very fast. He is going to then say to me that is not true and say to me over and over again that cannot be true. Tells me I am wrong.  I let him know what my family and I have experienced with the refrigerator, defrosting on its own, and the water and ice pouringcoming out very slow. When he told me I am wrong. I told him I am not wrong and I have witnesses and the issue with my water and ice dispenser went faster than what he claims he fixed. He then yells he is not working anymore. Sayed Faroz said he was leaving. I said leave I will report his actions and work performance to AHS. He said he would report me to everyone and tell no one to come and work for me. I heard him use profane language going out my garage. He wrote a negative remark on my receipt. Claiming I wanted to get a new refrigerator. I was never rude to him. But once he showed his ugliness I wanted him out of my house and off my property. I had a previous tech that came from another company that even stated there was something wrong with my compressor noticing the fan no longer was cooling the refrigerator down properly. The refrigerator is older has been in my home for 20 years. Dust accumulated under it. That does occur when a refrigerator has been in a home for along time. I have not been told to go under a refrigerator and take the grill off back to clean. He was very rude explaining this matter. However, Sayed Faroz was rude, nasty and surely not a person to listen when a customer explains their issue with their appliance. I am not trying to get anything new. I wanted my item fixed properly. He lied and said I was rude but I hope he knows I have proof of his actions at my home. I never want a tech in my home this unprofessional ever again. He needs to be retrained and monitored. Techs like Sayed bring your business down when they are not taught courtesy, respect and proper service skills. If he cannot come up to standards he should consider another line of work.

SEARS customer service is the total opposite. They ordered parts and said it would be 2 weeks before they all arrived and that's when my washing machine would be repaired. We received 2 of 3 parts so they rescheduled out another week. At this point I tracked this package, and it was coming up as unable to find so it was lost. When I called SEARS at week 3 to ask about reordering the part they kept saying someone would get back to me in 72 hours. I went online and was able to order the part at a local appliance store and picked up the part the very next day. I was also able to go online and order the part through Amazon and it would have arrived within 3 days. I feel like SEARS did nothing to help the situation. When I called they just kept saying the same thing ""someone will get back to you in 72 hours"" which they never ever called me back. I went and picked up the part I ordered and then called to let them know all of the parts had arrived. Then they scheduled me out another week to have it repaired. At this point I had been without a washing machine for an entire month and the amount of money I spent at the laundromat and the repair I could have bought a new washing machine.

Around 1pm on Thursday I received a text and email stating that my appointment was canceled. The appointment was rescheduled for March 28th, between 8am and 5pm. Again, I waited for the repairman to show up. I received updates that the repairman named Michael was in route to my residence. After 5:30pm I received an email and text from Sears stating that my appointment was canceled again. I wasted 2 days waiting on repairmen to complete a job. AND there's no way to speak to anyone at Sears. You can chat with an AI rep online but you can only view appointment details, cancel or reschedule service. I was livid. 2 wasted days.

It’s very unfortunate that as per usual, it doesn’t matter if something is fixed or not, AHS is still going to get their money regardless if you’re aware of the cause of the issue or not. If I am not a professional who can diagnose something myself why should I have to pay a premium AND service fee if there’s no guarantee of it being fixed because of technicalities. When I booked this dryer service online it asks me the symptoms of the dryer. Which I noted the dryer taking longer than usual. I did know that I had a tear in the vent, but of course there’s no option to add that for the people like me who are not professionals and don’t know that apparently vents are not considered an accessory of a dryer even though it’s attached! Which would’ve been nice as a feature to flag that it’s not covered under my plan. Shortly after I booked, I received a virtual text message from Sears asking me what my issue was. I included that my vent was torn. So instead of someone calling me and actually looking at my concerns to this AI messaging system to say that that’s actually not covered in a service and not in warranty, The Sears tech came anyway just to check my dryer and tell me they can’t help me. While the tech was still there I called AHS to verify that the vent was covered. I was told the tech needed to submit the diagnosis. I told the representative on the phone that it was a torn vent attached to the back and she told me that AHS would cover it since it’s something that’s broken on the dryer. Which tells me SHE DID NOT CHECK TO SEE IF THAT WAS FACTUAL! Two days later I check my account to see the service is “complete”. I call AHS to figure out when is someone supposed to come fix it and replace the vent. I was put on hold, only for the representative to come back and tell me that it’s actually not included in my plan……….Apparently the part about vents is in the fine print, and the only thing it says in the dryer section under appliances as far as what’s not covered is “accessories such as stands and drawers”. Shame on me for not checking the fine print, but you all CONTINUE to take people’s money and give customers false information without fully checking. And it would’ve been extremely helpful if Sears could’ve flagged they don’t cover vents for dryer services before they wasted my money! I’ll accept accountability for not knowing or understanding the full extent of my plan, but I definitely feel like Sears and AHS failed me in not actually checking what my concerns were and taking my money instead.

On the other hand, AHS leaves a bit to be desired.  One of the major reasons I went with you was because I was told that as long as I call for help during regular business hours, I would ALWAYS get a person from the USA to talk with me.  That was not true.  Also, when I called the second time to find out what the delay was, I was told that not only no request came out of the previous call but that I originally requested service via the internet (NOT TRUE).

I spent hundreds of dollars outsourcing my laundry for my family during that time. I have never been so dissatisfied with your company than I was during this frustrating period. Your customer service is horrible. I kept trying to get to a higher source to speak to someone and all I was doing was talking to someone who was going in circles. Every person in your customer service I can barely understand because they’re all foreign and I have hard time processing their accents. Not only could I not understand them. They did absolutely nothing to help me. I felt like I was a victim caught in between the service people and your company. The service people which was sears was at your mercy as well as I was. I lay the blame, not on them but on you. The communication was horrible. They kept ordering apart and then the part would be canceled. After 46 days, I finally received the information that the part has been discontinued. Had we had that information in week one I could’ve had a new l washer, which is what you all promise when I signed up. On another visit was my air conditioning went down when the guy came to fix my air conditioning. He had never seen a computerized thermostat and asked for my pamphlet with directions he had no idea what he was looking at. So I sent him on his way and had to call another air-conditioning company and pay out of pocket.

We had 3 prior before him and did not have a good experience. The first one didn't even take it apart. Just assumed it was the clutch. Then your next one showed up Saturday at 7:33 am. He never knocked or rang the ring doorbell. Stood on my porch for maybe a minute. Walks out to his van and leaves. At 8:13 i get a email stating i missed my appointment. Not sure how that works when your time is 8-5. I get up and message the online service. They rescheduled me for the same day from 11:30-12:45. I sit there all dau and he never shows up. So I have to reschedule again for another week out. That technician at leased listened to me when I was talking. He informs us the wrong part was ordered. Well no shit when you don't take a unit apart and just take a guess. Yep your going to order the wrong one. This. Technician tells us the clutch very rarely goes out. It doesn't cause the washer to do what it does. So they go ahead and order another clutch the right one. We wait 2 weeks for the part to get here. Now this technician was amazing. He looked at it and tore it apart. The seal to the bearing was allowing water to get in and that was the problem. They are replacing the washer cause it is to expensive to fix. If he would of came first this would of been handled 6 weeks ago. He needs praised,1561092,SEARS (MO-3),4306 WISCONSIN,JOPLIN,MO,APL,64804

It was finally repaired 3/25/2025. The worst part is there was no way to contact Sears to find out what the delay was since the part was sitting here at my home.. If more explanation is needed please don't hesitate to call me. I do appreciate the fact that you did try at one point to get this repair done but alas the appointment you made for me was subsequently canceled by Sears. They did call for that o ne and I was upset to the point that they scheduled the repair for the next day and it was done. Also I was told to unplug the refrigerator before they original repair date and water leaked so badly all over our wood  floor and it will now have to be repaired at additional expense to us. ,1559392,SEARS (PENSACOLA-3),1468 CACAO LN,PENSACOLA,FL,APL,32507

I believe it probably went into Sears but I could not let anyone know I didn’t get the part Until the day The technician was coming out to put it in because Sears does not allow you to call them and get a person on the phone to let them know any information ,so the big problem is not getting to talk to a person when you need to,?and I tried for several days, it could not get a person at Sears which delayed getting my service done.",1561472,SEARS (CORSICANA),108 LATIMER DR,TOOL,TX,APL,75143

I am very pleased with the initial response time from the time I submitted my service request. Then it went down hill. Victor arrived and spent less than 20 min here. He sat in his van about 6 min before approaching the door.  I did not actually interact with him, but I was in the next room. My husband said he checked the inside of the oven with some tester, then assessed it was the thermostat and baking element. Long story short, I was dissatisfied with the lack of direct communication I received from AHS and Sears thereafter. I had to check daily through the dispatch link. I called Sears several times to check status of parts. 

3 weeks later when parts finally arrived, upon Sears tech Mitchell arriving he said he shows a balance due, which set me off because I was told it was all covered. He basically said the first tech didn’t receive authorization or approval from AHS to proceed. So he made the call and all was well. So he proceeded to remove the back panel of the oven to find the wire harness was “fried”. He asked if the first tech even opened the back of the oven. He did not.

I was present when Mitchell contacted the parts dept direct to inquire about part for them to basically state it is no longer available. Mitchell further assessed more damage and stated that it was basically not repairable. So needless to say I was very angry that the first tech didn’t even remove the back to determine the extent of the problem. I was without an oven for 3 weeks longer than necessary. I truly appreciate Mitchell enduring by frustration and remaining cool and calm to take care of the problem by calling in and making sure everything was ok before he left. I am very pleased with AHS response time to close the order and get a replacement. ",1562852,SEARS (OK),1210 S ADAMS AVE,BLANCHARD,OK,APL,73010

I was promised the latest one for Wednesday.  Didn’t happen then nor on Thursday, yesterday.  Today is Friday and suspect I will be left hanging again over the weekend.

While the final visit resolved my issue, the process was frustrating due to inconsistent communication and unreliable scheduling. The 8am-5pm appointment window is already challenging, but I only received a notification for my first and last visits—missing updates for the second and third. 

On the first visit, the tech arrived after 2pm, which was manageable, but the second visit saw them show up at 4:57pm, just minutes before the window closed. The third visit was a complete no-show, again with no notification, which forced me to reschedule after 5pm that day. The fourth and final visit thankfully came with both a text and phone call, and the tech was able to solve the issue at last.

On the First scheduled visit no one came or called during timeframe for appointment.  There was no person to talk to as the AI system does all communication until tech calls when on the way.  All  parts ordered came at different times although AI system scheduled everything including next appointment. Second tech came and was unable to complete repair due to mix up with part order and scheduling by AI system.  Third Visit Tech installed all parts and appliance was not able to be repaired.  Which resulted in a longer process for replacement.  I'm sure this was not the first the system made an error, but this caused a lot of time and inconvenience since I had to be available for all appointments and  without the use of my appliance for so long.

I think they had to come out four times my husband had to end up helping the second one take the washing machine out from under the counter. He said he couldn’t get it. He told us we would have to have someone come out and take it out before he could work on it, but my husband helped him take it out from underneath the counter because he said it was installed wrong, which it wasn’t. It just had some insulation issues but the first guy that came out and diagnosed it. I’m assuming didn’t diagnose everything and then the second guy that came out to replace all the parts that were supposed to be replaced didn’t put the door on properly and when he put the front panel the control panel on the top he messed it up putting it on. Then no one knew that the pump was out until they put it all back together so then it wasn’t washing which one of the signs was that the soap was staying in the dish which then it was still staying in the dish. And now when you open the door, the top rack rolls out and you have to constantly put it back just to get to the bottom rack. I want to push the top rack in and put your dish in the bottom rack the top rack rolls back out so it’s not level. It still wasn’t cleaning all the dishes, but my husband said to give it a couple of washes and see what it’s doing and he will try to level it himself. The last man that came to work on it the update was that he would be here. I think it said somewhere before noon and he showed up at. I think it was 1245 but he didn’t come in till after 1:15.  It was just not a good experience all the way around looks like we could find a local repair man in the area to do these things. One guy was from Sherman over an hour away and I know he did not want to come back? I don’t blame him at all.  But still not sure that this is a complete repair and one of the filters that the lid was left off of in the second repair process. I showed him where the ring and side was basically peeled off. It’s a seal and he said yeah, it does that but he never replaced that ring. He just screwed the lid back on tight. It probably needs that O-ring on there. But I’m not a repair man so I don’t know.",1622032,SEARS (FT. WORTH-3),1407 S HUBBARD ST,ALVORD,TX,APL,76225

About three weeks ago, John, the technician, came to fix my refrigerator’s water dispenser. He replaced the pump and said another part needed to be ordered. It was unclear if the part would be shipped to my house or brought by the technician. The follow-up appointment was scheduled for March 12th. When John arrived, he asked for the part, which I never received. He then said he’d pick it up from the warehouse and return the next day.
On March 13th, John messaged me saying he’d arrive in 15 minutes. However, I was surprised to find him working at my neighbor’s house instead. He never checked the address or any paperwork before starting the job, which seems like a basic step for a professional. Even though we had already met twice, he didn’t seem to recognize me, which was quite strange. When I confronted him about the mistake, he didn’t apologize or offer to fix my issue—he simply left.
To make matters worse, John falsely reported the job as completed and even signed my name on the receipt without my consent. This level of unprofessionalism reflects poorly on Sears’ reputation. John was not polite, lacked a good sense of humor, and handled the entire situation poorly. I expect Sears to address this issue and ensure that John does not return to my house.",1559202,SEARS (ORLANDO),4722 RUBY RED LN,KISSIMMEE,FL,APL,34746

Since I was asked to be available from 8am-5pm with no clear idea of when he would show up - that was DAYS of my time wasted. Very frustrating.
