## Best Practices and Recommendations

### Development Best Practices
1. **Version control everything**: Code, prompts, configurations, and datasets
2. **Document extensively**: Architecture decisions, API specifications, and operational procedures
3. **Implement comprehensive logging**: Track all interactions, decisions, and system events
4. **Build with modularity**: Create reusable components and maintain clear separation of concerns

### Evaluation Best Practices
1. **Establish baselines early**: Define minimum acceptable performance before deployment
2. **Use diverse test datasets**: Ensure coverage across different use cases and edge scenarios
3. **Combine multiple evaluation methods**: Don't rely solely on automated or human evaluation
4. **Track evaluation metrics over time**: Monitor for regression and improvement trends

### Feedback Integration Best Practices
1. **Close the feedback loop quickly**: Acknowledge user feedback and communicate improvements
2. **Prioritize high-impact issues**: Focus on problems affecting the most users or critical functions
3. **Maintain feedback history**: Track how feedback led to specific improvements
4. **Balance different feedback sources**: Don't over-index on vocal minorities

### Continuous Improvement Best Practices
1. **Implement gradual changes**: Avoid drastic modifications that could destabilize the system
2. **Maintain rollback capabilities**: Ensure you can quickly revert problematic updates
3. **Document improvement rationale**: Record why changes were made and expected outcomes
4. **Measure improvement impact**: Validate that changes actually improve the metrics they target
