## Demand-Growth Update: **“Every Repair Becomes a Gateway”**

We convert each of the **≈ 30 000 weekly repairs** into a permanent, direct channel—so the next job never starts with a Google search or LSA bid.
The fly-wheel:

```
Repair  →  Asset On-Boarded  →  Always-On Monitoring / Easy-Scan  →  Direct Re-booking
```

### 3. “Appliance calls us” pathways

| Connectivity layer                            | Coverage today             | Roll-out plan                                                               | Agent / stack                                                                                       |

### 4. Marketing spend re-allocation

| Bucket                     | Old budget  | New budget              | Rationale                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Google LSA                 | \$600 k / Q | **\$420 k / Q (-30 %)** | Lower CAC from direct re-book channel. |
| Home Advantage QR kits     | —           | **\$90 k / Q**          | Printing + bonus pool.                 |
| Warranty renewal email/SMS | \$45 k / Q  | **\$75 k / Q**          | Larger subscriber base.                |
| OEM co-op marketing        | —           | **\$60 k / Q**          | OEM pays 50 %.                         |

Expected net spend change **–\$0.1 M** with **+\$4 M incremental gross profit** from warranty upgrades.

### 5. Balancing demand with tech supply

**Connection-rate metric**
`CR = # tagged assets activated ÷ # completes`   (target ≥ 70 %)

If CR rises but Slot\_Density falls below **0.9** (capacity tight):

* Dispatch opens **Sunday / evening windows** first.
* If still Red for 48 h → OT shift offers.
* Recruit if OT acceptance < 60 %.

### 6. KPI additions to dashboard

| KPI                             | Baseline | 90-day target | Owner          |

| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Print & ship 200 k QR/NFC tags; add scan-flow to TechHub.        |

| 6    | OEM #1 (Dishwasher) error-code feed integrated; pilot in 15 PAs. |
| 8    | Reduce LSA bids 15 % in PAs with CR ≥ 60 %.                      |
| 12   | Review: expect +12 k direct bookings / wk, warranty base +25 k.  |

### 8. Profit impact (12-month view)

| Stream                       | Incremental units   | GM%        | GP (\$M)     |

| **Total GP uplift**          | —                   | —          | **\$75.5 M** |

### Take-away

**Tag every repaired appliance → capture the homeowner → route future faults directly to us.**
This shifts spend from Google to owned channels, boosts warranty penetration, and fills tech calendars with high-margin, low-CAC jobs—while live Slot\_Density logic keeps payroll/revenue ratios on target.
