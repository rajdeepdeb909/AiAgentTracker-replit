### 1 — Moving seasoned technicians from “dispatcher‑led” to **self‑managed, AI‑supported** work

| Barrier you’ll hear                                              | Counter‑move that wins trust                                                                                                                                                               | Feature to highlight                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *“I’ll lose jobs or income if an algorithm controls the board.”* | **Earnings simulator** in the app shows historical take‑home under manual dispatch versus projected take‑home with AI routing (incl. less windshield time, higher first‑time‑fix bonuses). | Real‑time earnings meter + instant payout wallet.                      |
| *“Nobody will have my back when a job goes sideways.”*           | 24 / 7 **“Tech‑Assist” button**: a vision‑enabled GPT agent joins via camera, pulls schematics, and walks them through the fix—and escalates to a human master tech if confidence < 85 %.  | AR overlay + guaranteed human fall‑back within 3 min.                  |
| *“I’ll be micromanaged by bots.”*                                | Position the app as their **personal COO**: they decide which dayparts to open, which vertical badges to pursue, and when to cash out PTO points.                                          | Schedule‑auto‑block, skills marketplace, PTO wallet.                   |
| *Licensing & compliance anxiety*                                 | Compliance Agent monitors expirations, auto‑files state forms, pays renewal fees from a stipend before any penalty ever hits.                                                              | “Green‑light” compliance dashboard—always know you’re cleared to work. |

#### Roll‑out playbook

1. **Pilot with earned‑trust champions**
   *Hand‑pick 30 respected techs, brand them “Founders’ Circle,” give them concierge onboarding and ask for blunt feedback. Their testimonials will carry weight.*

2. **“Earn More in 14 Days” challenge**
   *Guarantee that early adopters who follow the AI‑based routing for two full weeks will earn ≥ 10 % more—or we pay the difference.*

3. **Shadow mode → co‑pilot → auto**
   *Week 1: app only *suggests* routes; Week 2: one click to accept; Week 3: full auto with opt‑out toggle.*
   *This lets skeptics see the algorithm outperform their gut before surrendering control.*

4. **Data‑to‑respect loop**
   *Weekly dashboards compare their key stats to the top decile and show the bonus trajectory. When they beat a personal best, a micro‑bonus drops instantly.*

5. **“Local locker hour” & office‑hours Zoom**
   *A predictable human touchpoint—same time every week—to surface edge‑case gripes. Keeps the relationship feeling human‑anchored even as most interactions move to the app.*
